## Local setup
On your terminal, simply do `docker-compose up --build`, and wait for the containers to build. Eventually, you'll be able to see the index page by going to `[http://127.0.0.1/](http://127.0.0.1/)`.

## Test coverage
To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate a coverage report:

```
docker-compose run --rm django pytest
```

This Application will Leverage the Kroger API and Recipe Datasources Across the Web to Create a Meal Plan, a Shopping List and a Savings Guide in one Integrated Web Based Application via Django, Reactive.js and Docker.
